## API Reference

API reference of all exposed modules and functions can be found [here](https://projectdiscovery.github.io/js-proto-docs/).

## Goja

[Goja](https://github.com/dop251/goja) is ECMAScript/Javascript engine/runtime written in pure go and has full support for ECMAScript 5.1. It is fast, can be used in goroutines and has very small memory footprint which makes it good fit for embedding in nuclei and provides additional layer of security and flexibility due to nature of javascript language and its implementation.

This does not break any nuclei design principle nor does it change how nuclei works and is dependency free. It complements nuclei engine by adding existing turing complete language (i.e javascript) instead of re-inventing the wheel by creating new DSL (domain specific language)
