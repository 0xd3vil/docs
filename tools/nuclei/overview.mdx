## What is **Nuclei?**

Nuclei is a fast exploitable vulnerability scanner designed to probe modern applications, infrastructure, cloud platforms, and networks, aiding in the identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities.

At its core, Nuclei utilizes templates—expressed as straightforward YAML files—that delineate methods for detecting, ranking, and addressing specific security flaws.

Each template delineates a possible attack route, detailing the vulnerability, its severity, priority rating, and occasionally associated exploits. This template-centric methodology ensures Nuclei not only identifies potential threats, but pinpoints exploitable vulnerabilities with tangible real-world implications.

## What does Nuclei produce?

The global security community, including numerous researchers and engineers, actively contributes to this template ecosystem. With over 6500 templates contributed thus far, Nuclei remains updated with real-world exploits and cutting-edge attack vectors, such as the Log4j vulnerability and RCEs that impact vendors such as GitLab, Cisco, F5, and many others.

Once configured, Nuclei can provide detailed information on each vulnerability, including:
